### Predicting MBA scores from Bachelor’s, Higher Secondary, and Secondary Scores using correlation and regression analyses.

I will focus on a dataset of 215 MBA students at XYZ campus in India, obtained from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement). If there is
strong evidence that there is a linear relationship between prior academic performance and
MBA performance at XYZ campus, it may be worthwhile to conduct similar analyses on MBA
students from other universities worldwide to answer my original research question.

Since obtaining a Bachelor’s degree is usually required to pursue an MBA program, I will first
construct and evaluate a simple regression model to predict one’s MBA Percentage from their
Bachelor’s Percentage. Then, I will construct a multiple regression model by including less
recent academic performances as additional predictors and using the forward selection
strategy to obtain a model of best fit.
